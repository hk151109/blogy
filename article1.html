  <div class="title"><b>Being unique is better than being perfect</b></div>

  <div class="meta">By Sara Kings and Nicole Kings - April 27, 2012 </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I’m the first to admit it – I love unique, flawed, imperfect things. I crave the muffins that have overflowed unevenly, and have that yummy, crackly, crunchy bit on the muffin top. I prefer a field of wildflowers, weeds and all, over a manicured, perfect flower garden. And place awonky, homemade, baked-with-love cake in front of me at birthday time, and I’ll smile from ear to ear.

        So why don’t we cherish these imperfections in ourselves? Our muffin tops, our short bodies, our big boobs, our scrawny arms, our frizzy hair? I try to embrace the things that make me different and unique, even beautifully flawed, but it’s tough.
        
        
        I always stop and slow down on November 11th to remember those who put their lives on the line to give us the peace and freedom we so much enjoy in Canada. We are so very thankful to military women and men, and their fami- lies, and we grieve those who have been lost. The grieving process is difficult for adults, and can be even more challenging for children. 
        
        I leave you with the words of one of the wisest people to walk this earth, Maya Angelou. She said <b>“If you are always trying to be normal, you will never know how amazing you can be.” So get out there, be unique, be weird, love your differences and be you!</b></p>
